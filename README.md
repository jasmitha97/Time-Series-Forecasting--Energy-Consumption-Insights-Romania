# Time-Series-Forecasting-Energy-Consumption-Insights-Romania
Project Overview
Energy consumption and production play a pivotal role in today's rapidly evolving world. As we strive for sustainability and efficiency, understanding the patterns and trends in energy utilization becomes increasingly crucial. This project centers on time series modeling of energy consumption, focusing on weekly data that provides a comprehensive snapshot of energy production and consumption dynamics.

The aim of this project is to analyze various energy sources such as hydroelectric, nuclear, wind, oil and gas, solar, biomass, and coal, and develop predictive models that help in forecasting energy consumption. By doing so, this project contributes to more informed decision-making in the energy sector, especially as we face growing global energy challenges.

Key Features
Data Exploration: The dataset includes multiple energy sources, such as renewable (hydroelectric, wind, solar, biomass) and non-renewable (nuclear, oil and gas, coal).
Predictive Modeling: We use time series analysis to predict energy consumption based on historical data.
Insights Generation: The project extracts meaningful insights from the data to inform decisions in energy management and policy.
Visualization: The project includes data visualizations to effectively communicate the patterns and trends in energy consumption.
Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

Date: The date on which the data was recorded.
Sum of Production: Total energy produced from all sources.
Hydroelectric: Energy generated from hydroelectric sources.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Time Series Modeling: Techniques such as ARIMA or Prophet to forecast future energy consumption patterns.
Insights and Findings
This project provides a detailed analysis of energy consumption patterns from multiple sources. The key findings include:

Energy Consumption Trends: By analyzing the time series data, we identified recurring patterns in energy consumption, such as weekly peaks and troughs, which correspond to fluctuations in industrial activity and seasonal variations.

Source-Specific Insights:

Hydroelectric, Wind, and Solar sources showed significant variability based on weather conditions. Periods of high energy output from wind and solar sources often coincided with lower fossil fuel consumption.
Nuclear energy remained a stable, non-variable source throughout the observed period, contributing a consistent baseline for energy production.
Oil and Gas, and Coal sources fluctuated more due to market demands and policy shifts.
Renewable vs Non-renewable Usage: There was a noticeable shift towards renewable energy sources, especially during periods where wind and solar production spiked. However, oil and gas consumption still accounted for a significant portion of overall energy use, especially in peak demand periods.

Predictive Modeling Results:

The time series model used for forecasting energy consumption revealed that renewable energy sources like wind and solar would likely continue their upward trajectory in the coming years, while reliance on coal and oil may plateau or decline due to increased policy focus on sustainability.
The model also forecasted periodic spikes in energy consumption tied to specific seasonal and industrial cycles, which could be crucial for planning and optimizing energy reserves.
Informed Decision-Making: The insights from this project can assist energy policymakers and utility companies in making data-driven decisions regarding future investments in renewable infrastructure and energy management strategies.
